Acceleration of Video Summarization Algorithms with Graphics Processors (GPUs) and Multicore CPUs
=====

This repository contains the code of my master degree dissertation created on 2014.
It has the parallel and sequential implementations for automatic video summarization methods proposed in [1] and [2].
